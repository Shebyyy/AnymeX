**Last Updated: September 6, 2025**

## Introduction
Welcome to **AnymeX**, a multiservice tracking client designed exclusively for managing and tracking anime, manga, novels, movies, and series through integration with the official APIs of **AniList**, **MyAnimeList (MAL)**, and **Simkl**. These Terms of Service ("ToS") and Disclaimer govern your use of AnymeX. By using AnymeX, you agree to comply with these terms and conditions. If you disagree, please do not use the app.

AnymeX is developed and maintained by Ryan Yuuki ("the Developer"). This document outlines the scope of AnymeX's functionality, user responsibilities, and disclaimers regarding third-party services and content.

## Scope of AnymeX
AnymeX is a client application designed solely for tracking anime, manga, novels, movies, and series by connecting to the official APIs of AniList, MyAnimeList, and Simkl. It provides a user interface to access, view, and manage your tracking data hosted by these third-party services.

**AnymeX does not:**
- Host, provide, distribute, maintain, endorse, or facilitate access to any streaming content, media, or third-party extensions, including but not limited to content from licensed providers such as **Crunchyroll**, **Funimation**, **Netflix**, **Hulu**, **HIDIVE**, or any other streaming platforms.
- Store, collect, or process personal information beyond what is required for authentication with supported third-party services (AniList, MyAnimeList, Simkl).
- Facilitate, manage, or promote access to any content, repositories, modules, or extensions outside the official APIs of AniList, MyAnimeList, and Simkl.

AnymeX is strictly a tracking tool and does not provide or enable access to any copyrighted material or streaming services. Any interaction with licensed content must be conducted through legitimate platforms like Crunchyroll, Funimation, Netflix, Hulu, HIDIVE, or other authorized providers, in compliance with their terms of service.

## User Responsibilities
By using AnymeX, you agree to:
- Use the app solely for its intended purpose of tracking anime, manga, novels, movies, and series via official integrations with AniList, MyAnimeList, and Simkl.
- Comply with the terms of service, privacy policies, and API usage guidelines of AniList, MyAnimeList, and Simkl, as well as the terms of service of any licensed streaming platforms (e.g., Crunchyroll, Funimation, Netflix, Hulu, HIDIVE) you access independently.
- Be solely responsible for your use of the app, including any interactions with third-party services, repositories, modules, or content accessed outside of AnymeX.
- Ensure your use of AnymeX and any third-party services complies with all applicable local, national, and international laws, including copyright, intellectual property, and Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) regulations.

You acknowledge that:
- AnymeX is a tool for interacting with the official APIs of AniList, MyAnimeList, and Simkl, and you are responsible for all activity associated with your accounts on these services.
- Any misuse of AnymeX, including unauthorized access to content, use of third-party extensions, repositories, or modules, is your sole responsibility. The Developer disclaims all liability for such actions or any resulting legal issues, including DMCA claims.
- Any legal concerns, including DMCA claims, related to content accessed through third-party services, repositories, or modules must be directed to those services or their respective creators, not AnymeX or the Developer.

## DMCA Compliance
AnymeX is designed to be fully compliant with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) and other applicable copyright laws. As a tracking tool, AnymeX does not host, distribute, or provide access to any copyrighted content. Any content accessed by users must be obtained through legitimate, licensed platforms such as Crunchyroll, Funimation, Netflix, Hulu, HIDIVE, or other authorized providers. If you believe that any content accessed through third-party services, repositories, or modules violates your copyright, please direct DMCA notices or legal inquiries to the respective service providers or content hosts, not AnymeX or the Developer. AnymeX does not control, endorse, or facilitate access to such content.
